2
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:05,792
(electrical zapping)

3
00:00:05,792 --> 00:00:08,230
- [Instrumental] Now we've
added all of our buttons

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,660
and our title text to our game.

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:13,550
But these buttons don't
actually do anything,

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:16,660
so we'll need to create a script to do so.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,720
One thing that we're gonna
do is just some clean up,

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,490
so, in fact, because we
copied that restart button

9
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,640
and duplicated it, if
you go to the on click,

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,760
if you select one of the
buttons in the Inspector

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,620
and scroll down, you can actually see

12
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,140
that it's still tied to the restart game

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,270
and we don't want these buttons to just

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,930
be restarting the game all the time.

15
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,320
So actually, in on click,

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,720
you can see the little minus button,

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,210
and if you just click that,
it'll remove that game manager.

18
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,100
So, go through each of
the different buttons,

19
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,190
remove those, so now,
we can't just magically

20
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,460
restart our game.

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,150
Definitely don't want that to happen.

22
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,870
Now what we're gonna do
is we're actually going

23
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,400
to make a new script now.

24
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:58,130
So in our Scripts folder,
we right-click, Create,

25
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,570
a C# Script.

26
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,520
And this script will be
called difficulty button,

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,490
to control the difficulty
when we use our buttons.

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,653
So we have that.

29
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:12,400
Now what we're gonna do is

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,630
we're going to actually select
all of our different buttons,

31
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,380
our easy, our medium, and our hard button,

32
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:21,630
and we're going to
scroll all the way down.

33
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,943
Now I'm going to add a component,

34
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,450
and we're going to actually search

35
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,120
for that difficulty button script.

36
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,270
There you go.

37
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,040
Now the difficulty button has been added,

38
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,380
and we can actually check each one.

39
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,730
One, two, three scripts.

40
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,563
Perfect.

41
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,420
Now, in our difficulty button script,

42
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,260
in order to interact
with those buttons again,

43
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,080
we need to make sure
that we use that library

44
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,640
that we had before, very handy.

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,640
So, UnityEngine.UI,

46
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,500
because the UI library helps
us interact with buttons.

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,550
So now, we need to get
references to our buttons,

48
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,460
so we'll make it private,

49
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,440
and we'll just call it button,

50
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,960
and we'll name it button,

51
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,280
cause we're getting this button,

52
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,500
so, in our start method,
we're just going to make sure

53
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,550
that we get the actual button component

54
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:20,030
on our button, so we
use our button variable,

55
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,940
and we get the component.

56
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,683
And we're looking for the
component called a button.

57
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,130
And then, make sure you add parentheses.

58
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,660
So now, we've attached
the scripts on to each

59
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,740
of our different buttons,

60
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,360
and we're making sure that
we get that button component

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,320
from our button, so we
can get a reference to it

62
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,790
in our difficulty script.

63
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,870
So, what you're gonna do
is, in each of your buttons,

64
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,270
make sure that you go
to the on click section

65
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,020
underneath the button components,

66
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,160
remove the reference to the game manager

67
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,680
on each of your different buttons.

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,140
You're then going to create
a difficulty button script,

69
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,600
and then make sure that you attach it

70
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,570
to each of your easy,
medium, and hard buttons.

71
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,470
And then, in your
difficulty button script,

72
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,970
you're going to make sure that
you use the UnityEngine.UI

73
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,530
so we can use buttons.

74
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,250
We're going to make a private variable

75
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,780
for our button component on our button,

76
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,950
and then in our start method,

77
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:21,720
we're going to make sure
that we get the variable

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,060
of our button and set it
to the button component

79
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,960
currently on our button.

80
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,910
Now it's your turn.

81
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:32,922
