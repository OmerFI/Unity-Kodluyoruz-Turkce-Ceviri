2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,560
- [Tutor] We've come a long way

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,730
in our prototype adventure here.

4
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,620
So, we've learned a whole lot

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,250
and added even more to this game.

6
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,470
We have this title screen
that has text on it.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,440
We have a score that keeps
track, we have these buttons

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,193
that can actually tell
how difficult the game is.

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,050
With each of these buttons

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:31,850
we can make all of these different objects

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,741
spawn faster or slower.

12
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:38,480
And if we miss one of these
boxes, our game is over.

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,263
We can't click the boxes.

14
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,510
If we restart our game,
it reloads the scene.

15
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,510
So now we have a really full
functioning game on our hands.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,600
We learned a whole lot of
programming along the way,

17
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,380
like learning how to
use listeners on buttons

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,550
to be able to use different methods.

19
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:02,570
We even used methods from
other scripts that we wrote

20
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,610
with parameters that
we can pass into them.

21
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,540
We learned how to use
this division operator,

22
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,730
similar to how we had multiplication

23
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,730
and addition and subtraction,

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,830
and we figured out this handy little trick

25
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,460
to be able to disable all
of our title screen elements

26
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,330
by nesting them underneath
our title screen game object,

27
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,580
and turning it on and off.

28
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:29,830
With the end of the prototype
we've come such a long way,

29
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,270
we've added all of this
amazing UI to our game,

30
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,220
like buttons and text.

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:38,760
We learned about mouse and click events,

32
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,423
like clicking on this button.

33
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,830
We learned about game states,
like restarting our game,

34
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:49,153
setting the difficulty for our players,

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,170
enabling them to actually
play and experience

36
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,723
the thing that we've created.

37
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,160
And with that, our game is
over and our prototype is over.

38
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,110
We'll see you soon.
