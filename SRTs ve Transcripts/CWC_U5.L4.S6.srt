00:00:00,504 --> 00:00:03,087
(techno tones)

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,180
- [Instructor] So, our game

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,270
is just about there.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:12,060
We have our title screen.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,500
We can click on one of the buttons.

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,060
We have all of these objects that spawn.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,070
We lose the game.

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,120
We can restart,

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,310
reload our scene.

10
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,570
We've got our title screen again.

11
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,560
The last thing we need to do

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,283
is actually make these
difficulty buttons work,

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,110
and then our players can
have a little bit of fun.

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,360
In our code,

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,150
in our difficulty button script,

16
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:38,040
we're going to create a public variable,

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,380
so we can assign them immunity.

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,770
This will be an integer,

19
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,410
if we're looking for just whole numbers,

20
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,860
and we'll call it difficulty.

21
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,210
Now, in Unity,

22
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,993
if we go to each of our buttons,

23
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,870
and we scroll down,

24
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,610
you can see that the
difficulty variable can be set.

25
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,850
So, for Easy,

26
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,033
we'll make the difficulty one.

27
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:05,320
For Medium, we'll set
the difficulty to two,

28
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:08,630
and for Hard, we'll set
the difficulty to three.

29
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,770
Yeah, because each of
these different buttons

30
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,010
all control there own variables.

31
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,223
It will be really easy to use them.

32
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,430
In our GameManager script,

33
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:20,760
we should go down to StartGame,

34
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,900
since that's what the
difficulty buttons are using,

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,670
and I'll actually pass in
an int difficulty parameter,

36
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,700
so that it will use this integer,

37
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,533
and then,

38
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:34,740
lucky for us,

39
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,710
because we actually
made a spawnRate before,

40
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,060
we can actually now use that variable

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,150
that we thought of before

42
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,090
to control our difficulty.

43
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,773
So, if we set our spawnRate,

44
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:54,470
and in this case,

45
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,330
we want our spawns to happen faster,

46
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:01,690
so we'll divide spawnRate
by the difficulty

47
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,500
that's passed in from our buttons.

48
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,110
So, when we pass in our
difficulty from our buttons,

49
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,830
for example, our Easy button,

50
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,430
our spawnRate here,

51
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,480
which is currently up to one second,

52
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,453
will be divided our Easy difficulty,

53
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:16,360
which is one.

54
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,880
So, one divided by one,

55
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,730
means our spawnRate will stay at one.

56
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,660
If we pass in our Medium button,

57
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,400
then our difficulty becomes two.

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,890
So, it will be one divided by two,

59
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,670
which is 1/2, or 0.5 seconds,

60
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,350
and if we use our Hard difficulty,

61
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,520
it will be divided by three.

62
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,810
So, one divided by three,

63
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,450
is 1/3, or 0.33 seconds.

64
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,710
If you remember, there's one little bit

65
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,050
of cleaner code that we can write.

66
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,400
So, this is pretty redundant, right here.

67
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,570
In fact, we can use the
same style of operator

68
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,910
that we used for adding
and multiplying values

69
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,700
that we were trying to multiply

70
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,090
themselves against other things.

71
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,360
So, if we do spawnRate

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,890
forward slash equals difficulty,

73
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,356
this means spawnRate is set to,

74
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,220
spawnRate divided by our difficulty.

75
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,220
Make sure we save that,

76
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,830
and now, in our difficulty button script,

77
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,020
StartGame is a little annoyed with us,

78
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:22,843
so we'll pass in our difficulty variable.

79
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,490
So, whenever one of the
different buttons is pressed,

80
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,930
it will send in that
difficulty to StartGame,

81
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,140
send that information to our GameManager,

82
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,760
which will then use
that updated spawnRate,

83
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,090
to spawn enemies faster or slower.

84
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,800
So, now we're really communicating

85
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,700
between the different
scripts that we've written.

86
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,410
Very similar to how we
were learning how to use

87
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,860
methods and parameters before.

88
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,540
If I save this,

89
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,080
and now, in Unity,

90
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,780
when I go to my game,

91
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,600
in this case I will select
the Maximize On Play button

92
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,030
on my game window,

93
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,433
so when I press play,

94
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,083
our game goes full screen.

95
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,980
If I press one of the buttons,

96
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,813
so, Easy,

97
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:11,497
we should see a fairly slow spawnRate.

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,253
If I restart,

99
00:04:18,006 --> 00:04:18,839
and I press Medium,

100
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,470
it should be a little bit faster.

101
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,253
That's very fast,
lot of skulls,

102
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,400
and if I restart one last time,

103
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,470
Hard mode, should spawn
a lot of boxes very fast.

104
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,170
I can't even click on all of them.

105
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,020
So, what you're gonna do,

106
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,880
in your difficulty buttons script,

107
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,360
add a public variable

108
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,170
that's an integer for your difficulty.

109
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,410
In Unity, select each of your buttons,

110
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:50,140
and now that you have
that difficulty variable,

111
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,650
you can set each one to be

112
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:52,810
one, two, three,

113
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,040
however difficult you want it to be.

114
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,963
In our GameManager script,

115
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,960
if you go to your StartGame,

116
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,490
pass a parameter into
it using int difficulty,

117
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,980
add a parameter with
our spawnRate variable.

118
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,720
We're going to divide
that by the difficulty.

119
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,450
So, that way our objects spawn faster,

120
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:16,220
and then finally in difficulty button,

121
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,640
under set difficulty,

122
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,810
make sure you pass the difficulty variable

123
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,940
into your StartGame method.

124
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,670
Then test your game one final time

125
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,430
using the Maximize On Play button

126
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,380
in your game window.

127
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,590
So, when you press play

128
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,233
your game goes full screen.

129
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,180
Now, it's your turn.

130
00:05:38,147 --> 00:05:40,814
(techno tones)
