00:00:00,895 --> 00:00:03,312
(game music)

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,833
- Our game is so close to being done.

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:11,950
If we play our game,

4
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,850
You see now, none of
these boxes spawn anymore.

5
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,890
But then when we click
one of the difficulties,

6
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,453
then our boxes start spawning.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,500
The problem is, they don't
go away when the game's over,

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,520
or even when the game starts.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,160
So we're gonna have to fix that.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,500
Now we can do something similar

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,870
to how we handled our game over
text and our restart button,

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,610
but honestly I'm pretty lazy

13
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,610
and I don't want to just turn all

14
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,630
of these buttons and
texts off individually.

15
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,010
And then I have to turn
them on again and it's the-

16
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,430
it's a whole it's a whole thing.

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,980
So, we can actually cheat a little bit,

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,510
and we can use a really nice little tip.

19
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:52,850
So, if we right click on
canvas, we're going to create

20
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:54,600
a new empty object.

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,330
And I'm going to rename our
game object 'title screen',

22
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,800
because this will be
where store all of the

23
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,490
different objects related
to the title screen.

24
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,590
And in fact,

25
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,180
if I select all of the different text

26
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,710
and buttons for the title.

27
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,960
So I can select my title
text shift click down

28
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,770
to the hard button.

29
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,940
Left click and drag into the title screen,

30
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,730
now they're all nested
underneath the title screen.

31
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:23,730
In fact, I can do something
super useful and easy.

32
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,863
If I disable the title screen game object,

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,950
all of the objects underneath
it actually disable too.

34
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,140
So, with this handy little
trick, I can turn off

35
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,490
and on our title screen
whenever I need too.

36
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,890
In our game manager script,
I'm going to need a reference

37
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,620
to that object, so make it public.

38
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,440
We'll call it a 'game object'
since it's just a game object.

39
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,503
And then it'll be the
title screen game object.

40
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,440
Now I'm going to make
sure in my game manager,

41
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,420
that I assigned the
title screen so I'm going

42
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,560
to left click and drag
the title screen object

43
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,923
into the little slot.

44
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,830
And then I'll save that.

45
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,380
And then I'm going to add in
one last little bit of code,

46
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,580
in our start game.

47
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,070
So, when our game has
started, I'm actually going

48
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,093
to get the title screen game object,

49
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,150
and we're going to disable it,

50
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,220
so we'll set active to false.

51
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,400
So now, this should turn
off our title screen.

52
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,070
If we do a quick test, we should now,

53
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,160
when I click one of these buttons,

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,600
have our title screen disappear.

55
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,060
There you go, awesome!

56
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,683
So now we can get back
to playing our game,

57
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,913
and then when we lose the game,

58
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,143
we can restart,

59
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,413
and play all over again.

60
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,530
So what you're gonna do is
in your canvas make sure

61
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,500
to right click and create an empty object.

62
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,100
You're going to rename that
empty object the title screen

63
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,730
because that's what will be holding all

64
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,280
of our title screen elements.

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,090
We're going to take out title
text, our easy, our medium,

66
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,640
and our hard button and drag
them into our title screen,

67
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,650
so that they're nested as child objects.

68
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,330
In our game manager script,
you're going to make sure

69
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,780
to create a variable for that
title screen game object.

70
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,233
Make sure you assign it in unity as well.

71
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,000
And then in your start game,

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,320
you're going to set the
title screen game object

73
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,900
to inactive. You're going to disable it

74
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,980
when we use the start game
method when we click a button.

75
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,573
So now it's your turn.

76
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,077
