00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,770
- [Instructor] Our title
screen is now looking amazing,

2
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,430
but we do have this problem

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,230
where we're not actually
starting the game.

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,490
The game has already started.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:17,360
And we can actually
click all of these boxes,

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,960
but, in fact, we can
also click these buttons,

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,520
which is helpful.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,130
And down in the bottom you can see

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,060
we know which button was clicked.

10
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,860
In fact, if I squeeze between this button

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,750
I can restart the game, so that's fun.

12
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:32,683
So I actually need to fix that
and actually start our game.

13
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,350
Now, in our game manager's script,

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:37,600
since this is the script

15
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,460
that's managing all the different states

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,070
that our game is going through.

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,760
Like restarting and game over,

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,590
we'll add a start game method into this,

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,720
so we don't have to keep immediately

20
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,113
starting the game on start.

21
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,320
So, we'll add a new method,

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,153
we'll make it public,

23
00:00:56,153 --> 00:00:58,750
so we can use it outside of this class.

24
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,253
It'll be void, and it'll
be called start game.

25
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,220
Luckily, we've already written
code to start our game.

26
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,313
So, we're just gonna use that.

27
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,110
In our start method here,

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,440
you can see that we have
our different settings.

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,890
So we'll take all of these

30
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,333
and we'll cut them out
of our start method,

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,980
and we'll paste all of that
code into our start game.

32
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,330
So now when the game is started,

33
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,440
we know that the game is set to active.

34
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,450
Our score is reset,

35
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,690
and then we can start
spawning all of our enemies.

36
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,430
Make sure we save,

37
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,270
and then, in our difficulty button script,

38
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,000
we're actually going to need a reference

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,090
to the game manager,

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,130
just like we did in our target script.

41
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,960
So this will be private,

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,440
and we just need to get our game manager,

43
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,590
and we'll call it the game manager,

44
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,270
because that's what it is.

45
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,420
Now, in our start method,

46
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:54,450
we also need to get a
reference to that game manager.

47
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,360
So we'll get our game manager variable,

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,740
and we'll set it or assign it

49
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,220
to the game manager game object.

50
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:08,220
So, if we use game
object in our hierarchy,

51
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,500
we will find the object
that's called game manager.

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,180
And then once we've found that object,

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,923
we'll need to get its component,

54
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,853
which is handily also
called the game manager.

55
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,220
And then in our set difficulty method,

56
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,173
we can now use our game manager.

57
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,163
And we can use the start game
method, that we wrote before.

58
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,770
So, if we test our game now,

59
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,223
nothing should happen when we press play.

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,210
None of those crates are spawning,

61
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,510
but then, if we press one of our buttons,

62
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,833
let's go for easy mode,

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,530
there you go you've got
some crate spawning.

64
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,800
And then our game should go over,

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,563
get the game over, cool.

66
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,550
So we're almost there,

67
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,110
but at least now we can start the game

68
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,070
when we press one of the buttons.

69
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,930
So, what you're gonna do

70
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,500
in your game manager script,

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,200
you're going to create a new
method called start game.

72
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,230
And then we can just grab all of the code

73
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,193
from our start method at the top,

74
00:03:20,043 --> 00:03:23,740
and paste it down into start game.

75
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,023
In our difficulty button script,

76
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,580
create a variable for the game manager.

77
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,090
Make sure to find that
game manager in the scene,

78
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,130
and then get the component
of its game manager script,

79
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,533
so we can get the variables.

80
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,050
And then, in set difficulty,

81
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,000
you can then call game
manager, dot start game,

82
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,370
so, when we click one of the buttons,

83
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,910
it'll then run this line
of code and start our game.

84
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:50,860
Now it's your turn.
