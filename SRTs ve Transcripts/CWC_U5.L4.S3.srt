00:00:00,973 --> 00:00:03,390
(soft music)

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,100
- [Male Instructor] On
each of our buttons,

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,800
we've now applied scripts to them,

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,570
and now we actually want to use a method,

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,790
so that way, our buttons know, what to do.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,010
Now, in our difficulty buttons script,

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,340
we're going to create a new method,

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,890
this one will just make private,

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,363
so we'll just say void set difficulty.

10
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,980
'Cause I don't believe
we'll need this later,

11
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,450
we'll just need it inside of this class.

12
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:34,930
And then, for set difficulty,
we're just going to test

13
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,150
and see if it works for now
using a debug.log method,

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,670
so that way we can print
out to our console in Unity,

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,500
and we're actually going to
get the button.gameObject.name,

16
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,150
so this will give us
the name of our button.

17
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,150
Then, we'll use a literal
string, to say, was clicked,

18
00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,880
so then when we press one
of the buttons, for example,

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,070
it should say easy button was clicked.

20
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,570
And then, one thing we do
need to do, is we actually

21
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,200
need to use this method to
see when a button was clicked.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,793
So, we can actually say button.

23
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,470
Now, similar to what we had
with the restart button,

24
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,450
where it had an onclick
method, to listen for when

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,890
the button was clicked by the mouse,

26
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:25,270
we can actually use that
in code, so we can actually

27
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,220
use onclick, so when
the button is clicked,

28
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,920
we need our game to
listen, to pay attention,

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,080
to when it's actually been
clicked, so in this case,

30
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,760
in programming we call
this adding a listener,

31
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,120
so that way it pays attention

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,220
for when a certain event has happened.

33
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,130
In this case, a click event.

34
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,440
And then, we can just use a
method to pass into our listener

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,130
so we can actually just
use our SetDifficulty.

36
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,470
So, when our button is
clicked, then it will go

37
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,850
into the SetDifficulty method,

38
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,620
and then we should see
which button was clicked.

39
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,330
So, if we test this out in
Unity, I happen to already

40
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,730
have my console window, as a tab here,

41
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,490
so we'll keep this open.

42
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,573
If I press play.

43
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,180
And I click the easy button,
easy button was clicked,

44
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,900
hard button, hard button was clicked,

45
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,710
medium button, medium button was clicked.

46
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,720
Awesome, so, we know that our listeners

47
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,530
were set up properly.

48
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,130
So, what you're gonna do,
is you're going to create

49
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:34,460
your own, private method, it'll
be void called SetDifficulty

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,580
just a test, and see that
it works, you're going

51
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:41,810
to use a Debug.Log method,
so that way we can print out

52
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,420
the name of the button that was clicked,

53
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,500
and then in our start method,
you're going to make sure

54
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,853
you add a listener to your
button, for the onClick event,

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,983
and when the button is clicked,

56
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:58,300
it'll go into the SetDifficulty method,

57
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:01,963
and it should trigger this
message in your console.

58
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,770
Now it's your turn!

59
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:07,420
