1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,422
(computerized tones)

2
00:00:03,422 --> 00:00:05,720
(electrical humming)

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,490
- Now we just need to add
a few more UI elements

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,400
to our game.

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,040
So we've made it so we
can restart our game.

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,260
But we want to be able
to set the difficulty

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,910
for our players.

8
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,180
To do that, we'll actually just duplicate

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,320
some of our text and our buttons.

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,830
So our Game Over Text,

11
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,150
since our title will be in the same place.

12
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,840
If we select our Game Over Text

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,253
and duplicate with Control + D,

14
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,800
we have Game Over Text again.

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,130
We'll set this to active.

16
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:40,263
And I'm going to rename the
text to be our title text.

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,590
And then we don't want
our text to be the same

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:47,870
as our Game Over 'cause that
would be really confusing.

19
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,730
So what we'll do is we'll change our text

20
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,020
and we'll come up with a clever title.

21
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,020
So I'm gonna call this Clicky Crates.

22
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:02,100
Now I don't want it to be red
so I'm going to change that

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,560
and we'll make it the
exact opposite color.

24
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,803
So that'll be,

25
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,650
let's see maybe a
greenish, maybe a blueish.

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,970
Ooh I like that blue, that one looks good.

27
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:13,803
Maybe a little darker.

28
00:01:13,803 --> 00:01:14,636
There you go.

29
00:01:14,636 --> 00:01:15,742
Cool.

30
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:16,750
So now we have our Clicky Crates.

31
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,820
Now what we also need to do
is make some more buttons.

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,270
So I'll actually take our Restart button

33
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,230
and we'll duplicate this.

34
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,973
And we'll set this back to
active so we can see it.

35
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,035
Now our Restart button, this
one will be our Easy button

36
00:01:30,035 --> 00:01:33,270
because we definitely
wanna start easy first.

37
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,830
And then we go into our
Easy button by expanding.

38
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,840
We'll change our text
because we wanna make sure

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,120
that we know it's easy mode.

40
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,100
Easy.

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,540
Now our button is definitely
a little bit too large

42
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,280
so we'll actually change the width

43
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,323
to make it a bit smaller.

44
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,233
So I'll make it something
like, yeah, something like now.

45
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,940
I like this as a nice round
number so it's easier.

46
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,440
So 115,

47
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,273
cool.

48
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,770
And then we'll reposition this

49
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,480
so let's see if I move it not on the Y.

50
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,960
In fact I want it to move on the X.

51
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,793
So

52
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,470
if we move Easy over

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,743
to about there, cool.

54
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,580
And then

55
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,240
let's see so we wanna do the same thing.

56
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,330
We'll make a Medium difficulty button

57
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,623
so we'll duplicate that.

58
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,150
That time I just right click duplicated.

59
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,693
Call this Medium button.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,223
We wanna re-change the text
back to medium this time.

61
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,590
Now the problem here is our
button is actually on top of

62
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,500
our Easy button.

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,870
So we can't actually see that so

64
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,220
let's see.

65
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,053
Let's put this--

66
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:49,570
what happens if we put it to zero?

67
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,540
Okay, button's a little tight.

68
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,830
Let's see if we change the width maybe to

69
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,650
100.

70
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,330
Okay, that fits pretty well.

71
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,810
Change our Easy button back to 100.

72
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,713
Have some nice symmetry.

73
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,870
And then our Medium button,

74
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,790
we'll do the same thing.

75
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,700
We'll Control + D,

76
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,250
Command + D to duplicate.

77
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,240
So this'll be our Hard
button for hard mode.

78
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,880
And then, let's see, our
Easy button was about

79
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:20,883
negative 115.

80
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,490
So to get some good symmetry
going, we'll make this

81
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,740
position 115, cool.

82
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,400
Now it's all even.

83
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,300
And then last but not least,

84
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,603
we change the text on our
Hard button to be hard.

85
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,410
And now we have a hard mode.

86
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,040
So that makes it a lot easier
for the players to see,

87
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,873
what buttons to press.

88
00:03:41,873 --> 00:03:43,130
They don't really do anything right now.

89
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,860
But it certainly looks really good.

90
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,050
So what you're gonna do

91
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:48,930
is you're going to create
your own title text

92
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,930
and your three difficulty buttons.

93
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,310
So what you can do is
just go right click over

94
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,200
Game Over Text, duplicate,
and then make sure you rename

95
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,740
that to the title so that way you know

96
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,620
the difference between the two.

97
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,950
You can do the same thing
with the Restart button

98
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:05,160
to make each of your different buttons.

99
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,630
Make sure to set them all to active

100
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,190
so you can see them back on your scene.

101
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,760
Rename them, reposition
them and make it look

102
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,180
really nice.

103
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,130
Now it's your turn.

104
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:15,951
(computerized tones)

105
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,756
(electrical humming)
