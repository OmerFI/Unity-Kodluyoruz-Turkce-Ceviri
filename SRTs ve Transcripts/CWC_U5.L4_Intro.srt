00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,601
(electronic whir)

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,230
- We have the UI for our
score during the game,

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,050
We have the UI for the Game
Over at the end of the game,

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,060
so now we need to make this
experience fully playable

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,710
by adding a UI for the title screen

6
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:20,103
at the start of the game.

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:24,540
At the start, you need
the title text, of course,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,160
but you also want to give the player

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,000
a menu with options for how
they can experience the game,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,810
more specifically, how difficult
they want the game to be.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,110
If you have an Easy,
Medium, and Hard setting,

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,860
your game can be fun for a lot longer.

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,480
Users can start off easy and graduate

14
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,850
to more difficult settings,
testing their skills.

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:47,600
So by the end of this lesson,

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,000
you will have a title screen
with three difficulty buttons,

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,170
where the Easy setting will
make the objects spawn slowly,

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,620
but the Hard setting will
make them spawn faster.

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,920
To make these buttons function,

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,270
we're going to do the
most advanced programming

21
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,280
we've done yet,

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,193
but don't worry, you can handle it.

23
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,160
When one of these buttons is clicked,

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,693
the Button Listener will
call a SetDifficulty method.

25
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:16,950
That SetDifficulty method
will take the difficulty value

26
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,993
and communicate it to
the GameManager script.

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,292
And in the GameManager script,

28
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:26,310
the StartGame method will
take that difficulty value

29
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,463
and use it to alter the spawnRate.

30
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,460
If all of that sounds
complex, that's because it is.

31
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,590
But this is the last lesson
of the final prototype.

32
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,233
You've come all this way
and you're ready for it.

33
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,283
So, to make all that happen,
I'll see you in Unity.

34
00:01:44,576 --> 00:01:47,409
